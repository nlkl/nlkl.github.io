My name is Nils LÃ¼ck and I am a software developer currently residing in Copenhagen, Denmark. I work as a .NET (C#) developer, but my interests span more widely. Specifically, I enjoy functional programming, simplistic software design, and programming languages in general.

This blog reflects my opinions on computer science and software development in general.
