                <p>My name is Nils Lück and I am a software developer currently residing in Copenhagen, Denmark. I work as a .NET (C#) developer, but my interests span more widely. Specifically, I enjoy functional programming, simplistic software design, and programming languages in general.</p>

                <p>This blog reflects my opinions on computer science and software development in general.</p>

                    <p><strong>Let me start by stressing</strong> that I do like F#, and this post is not a bashing of F# as such. I think F# has a lot to offer, and I recognize the compromises the language designers had to make, in order to make the .NET integration <a href="#">as smooth as possible.</a></p>

                    <p>However, <code>all programming languages</code> have intrinsic flaws, and this post simply highlights some of the aspects of F# that I find somewhat annoying. As you have already guessed, this post will be highly subjective ;)</p>

                    <h2 id="ocaml-heritage">OCaml heritage</h2>

                    <p>F# is both semantically and syntactically inspired by OCaml. Whereas this might make the language more familiar to OCaml developers, I believe that this choice has had a negative impact on the overall language design.</p>

                    <p>The original F# syntax was closely inspired by that of OCaml. Since then, a “lighter” syntax was introduced (and made default), which removed a lot of the syntactic overhead of the old syntax. Even with the lighter syntax, however, the overall syntactic elements closely resemble those of OCaml, which means that F# is filled with lots of “arbitrary” syntactic decisions.</p>

                    <p>Particularly, I think that F# could have borrowed a few of the syntactic improvements of Haskell, to make the code a bit easier on the eyes. </p>

                    <p>One example of this is tupled value constructors, which produces a lot more noise than Haskell’s curried version (I recognize that this is also a semantic difference). Consider the following contrived example:</p>

                    <p>And a hypothetical curried version could look like this:</p>

                    <p>Notice that the curried version is not only cleaner, but also more flexible, and doesn’t rule out that we could use a tupled version if we should so desire.</p>

                    <h2 id="too-much-oop">Too much OOP</h2>

                    <p>Whereas F#’s OCaml heritage is only a minor annoyance, my primary F# pain point is the amount of OOP interop that is forced onto you.</p>

                    <p>F# comes with a small functional standard library, providing things such as list-manipulation and the like. As long as this is all you need, the world is all peachy. However, as soon as you are working on a task of non-trivial size, you will need to use functionality from <em>somewhere else</em>, as the F# standard library simply doesn’t offer too much functionality out-of-the-box.</p>
